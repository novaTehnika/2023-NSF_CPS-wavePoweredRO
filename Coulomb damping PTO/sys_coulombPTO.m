% PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
% Calculate the state derivatives for a simple wave energy PTO with coulomb
% damping. For use as an intermediate step in modeling PTO archetectures in
% the 2021Q2 PTO modeling project. The model includes the hydrodynamic WEC
% model found in the 2021Q2 Hydrodynamic modeling project (but really
% developed in 2018) and assumes a constant PTO torque magnitide.

% UPDATES:
% 6/23/2021 - V01x00 - created from sysPTOwPL_V01x00.m to be
%           used in simPTO_V02x00.m.
